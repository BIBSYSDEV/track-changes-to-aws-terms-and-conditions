Salesforce Infrastructure and Sub-processors
Published: February 18, 2025

Scope
This documentation describes the infrastructure environment, sub-processors and certain other entities material to the services and managed
packages listed in the Infrastructure and Sub-processors Table below (collectively, for the purposes of this document only, the “Covered
Services”). Services or features not yet generally available may be included within the list of Covered Services for the purpose of providing
Customers advance notice of new sub-processors or processing locations. Any reference to future services or features does not obligate Salesforce
to make those services or features available. Capitalized terms used in this documentation are defined in Salesforce’s MSA and/or Data Processing
Addendum.
Some Covered Services are hosted on Salesforce’s own first-party infrastructure. Many of the Covered Services are fully or partly hosted on thirdparty infrastructures (e.g., Hyperforce), which operate as Salesforce’s sub-processors. For more information about Hyperforce, see below. Many of
the Covered Services run across multiple infrastructures as identified in the Infrastructure and Sub-processors Table below. Our Services are
interconnected in order to provide more features to Customers within a single service. This can happen in a few different ways. For instance:
●

●

Some Services run primarily on one infrastructure, but have some features that run partly or entirely on different infrastructures. For
example, for many Customers, most Sales Cloud features run on the Salesforce’s first-party infrastructure, but Sales Cloud also includes
Einstein1 Features that run on the Einstein Platform infrastructure. Similarly, the Marketing Cloud Engagement Services are based primarily
on the Marketing Cloud Engagement infrastructure, but some features of Marketing Cloud run partially on Einstein Platform or Marketing
Cloud Einstein infrastructure. If these features are enabled, Customer Data will be processed by these additional infrastructures.
Some Services may inherently copy data from one infrastructure onto another infrastructure for processing to function. For example, this
happens when Sales Cloud Customer Data is copied into the Sales Cloud Einstein-specific infrastructure, for artificial intelligence analytics,
before the scores and predictions are written back into the original Sales Cloud infrastructure. Another example is Intelligence Reports for
Engagement may pull a copy of Customer Data from Marketing Cloud Engagement onto its own infrastructure to provide reporting
functionality.

If a Covered Service includes features which run across multiple infrastructures using different sub-processors or hosted in different locations, the
Infrastructure and Sub-processors Table will list each infrastructure involved in running the Service as a separate “purpose of processing” row
detailing how, and for what features, each infrastructure is used.

Sub-processor Notifications
Salesforce Customers may subscribe to notifications of new sub-processors for those Covered Services for which Customer has a then-current
active subscription by filling out this form.

Sub-processors Storing Customer Data
Many Services offer multiple alternative locations to process and/or store Customer Data. Except as set forth in the “Additional Details” column in
the Infrastructure and Sub-processors Table, each cell listing countries in the table below represents an available “region” in which Salesforce
processes and/or stores data for a given purpose. For example, for the Salesforce Services, data from our Germany data center is backed up into
France, and so France and Germany are listed in the same cell to indicate that the “region” includes both countries. If France and Germany are in
separate cells for a given purpose of processing, your Customer Data would only be stored in one of the two countries.
When a Service offers alternative locations to process/and or store data, the Customer may be able to choose their region during the setup
process or by working with an Account Executive.2 You may also request to have your Customer Data for a Covered Service or feature hosted in a
different region, which may be accommodated, subject to availability. Further, if your Customer Data is hosted in a different region for one
Covered Service, this may also affect where your data is hosted in other related services (e.g., hosting data in Europe for Service Cloud will cause
your Service Cloud Einstein data to be hosted in Europe). If you have any questions about where your data is stored that this Documentation does
not answer, please contact Customer Support.
In addition to the locations identified in the below Infrastructure and Sub-processors tables, Salesforce may store across its processing locations
identifying information about Customers’ instance(s) and identifying information about Users for the purpose of operating the Services, such as
facilitating the login process and the provision of customer support. For the Government Cloud Plus and Government Cloud Plus - Defense
Services, this information (except for business address) will be encrypted with a one-way hash algorithm before it leaves the Government Cloud
Plus and Government Cloud Plus - Defense-specific data centers, rendering it unreadable to Salesforce and its cloud providers.

Customer Support
Salesforce uses its online services to provide customer support, including generative artificial intelligence. Sub-processors for the online services
are listed below.

2 Sandbox copies are created at a data center level; any instance can refresh to any sandbox within a data center. Sandbox copies in a data center may be

redirected to another data center in the same region, if necessary, to maintain performance levels. As an example, an EMEA-based sandbox instance could
redirect to another EMEA data center. Temporary developer testing environments branded as “Scratch Orgs” may be provisioned in a different Salesforceoperated data center from a Customer’s instance of the Covered Services, but within the same region as such instance. Scratch Orgs created by public cloud
Customers reside within the Public Cloud Infrastructure.

Content Delivery Networks (“CDNs”)
CDNs are utilized to optimize content delivery for certain Covered Services as listed in the Infrastructure and Sub-processors Table. CDNs are
commonly used systems of distributed services that expedite the transmission of content. Note that if a CDN is described as “Global” in the Table,
it may process data in any country, regardless of the Customer’s location, to better support end-users of the applicable Covered Services.

Related Services
Salesforce offers highly customizable software used by Salesforce Customers across a variety of industries and businesses. Salesforce sells
functionality to Customers in many packages, which we call SKUs.
Sometimes these SKUs only include functionality from one or more Services. But often, these SKUs can bundle functionality from one or more
Services, along with additional, industry-specific functionality to customize the Service to an industry or business need.
One particular example of this is the “Salesforce Services”: Chatter, Experience Cloud (formerly Community Cloud), Database.com, Lightning
Platform (including Force.com), Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Site.com). Because the Salesforce Services functionality is bundled in so many
different ways in different SKUs, the Infrastructure and Sub-processors Table cannot tell you whether or not the SKU you purchase contains a
particular feature within the Salesforce Services. Instead, the table lists all features that appear in any packaging of the Salesforce Services. If you
have a question about whether the SKU you purchase contains a particular feature, consult the Help and Training Documentation or your Account
Executive.

Hyperforce
Hyperforce is Salesforce’s next-generation infrastructure foundation for deploying application stacks on commercial cloud providers. An up-todate list of available regions for Hyperforce can be found here. Not all Covered Services hosted on Hyperforce are available in every location.
Please see the charts below for available locations for individual Covered Services.

Support For All Services
Note that for support of the Covered Services designated as “Services on the Hyperforce Operating Zone infrastructure” or “HF OZ”, in limited
circumstances, Customer Data may be stored and/or processed outside of the available region selected by Customer and as described in the
“Services on the Hyperforce Operating Zone Infrastructure” section of the Hyperforce SPARC.
