#  Atlassian Sub-processors

_Effective Starting May 30, 2025_

###  Third-Party Sub-processors

Atlassian uses the third-party entities listed below (each, a **“Sub-
processor”**) to process Customer Personal Data on behalf of Atlassian
customers and developers in accordance with agreements between Atlassian and
the Sub-processor to uphold Atlassian’s commitments in [Atlassian's Data
Processing Addendum](/legal/data-processing-addendum), or for Forge,[
Atlassian’s Forge Data Processing
Addendum](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/resources/Forge-Data-
Processing-Addendum.pdf). Defined terms, such as “Personal Data”, “Customer
Personal Data”, “Sub-processor”, “Cloud Products”, or “End User Personal Data”
have the same meaning as in [Atlassian's Data Processing
Addendum](/legal/data-processing-addendum#scope-and-term), [Atlassian's
Customer Agreement](/legal/atlassian-customer-agreement#intro), or
[Atlassian’s Forge Data Processing
Addendum](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/resources/Forge-Data-
Processing-Addendum.pdf), as the case may be.

Atlassian carries out annual compliance reviews of its Sub-processors, and
where the engagement of a Sub-processor requires the cross-border transfer of
Personal Data, Atlassian conducts Transfer Impact Assessments in accordance
with Applicable Data Protection Law for these data transfers. Atlassian
imposes obligations on its Sub-processors to implement appropriate technical
and organizational measures ensuring that the sub-processing of Personal Data
is protected to the standards required by Applicable Data Protection Law and
the same standard provided by Atlassian’s [Data Processing
Addendum](/legal/data-processing-addendum#scope-and-term), or for Forge, the
[Forge Data Processing
Addendum](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/resources/Forge-Data-
Processing-Addendum.pdf), as the case may be.

The list below contains Sub-processors for each of Atlassian’s generally
available Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services, as well as
Forge. If a Beta or EAP service uses a new Sub-processor, Atlassian may use an
alternative notification mechanism. For each Sub-processor below, processing
of Personal Data will be for the duration of use of the applicable service(s)
by the customer or the developer, and for the retention periods as set out in
the customer’s agreement with Atlassian and any product documentation. Further
information about Sub-processor security measures can be found via the
external links below.
