#  Atlassian Sub-processors

_Current as of June 22, 2023_

###  Third-Party Sub-processors

Atlassian uses the third party entities below (each, a “sub-processor”) to
process personal data on behalf of Atlassian customers and in accordance with
contract terms between Atlassian and the sub-processor to uphold Atlassian’s
commitments in [Atlassian's Data Processing Addendum](/legal/data-processing-
addendum), or for Forge,[ Atlassian’s Forge Data Processing
Addendum](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/resources/Forge-Data-
Processing-Addendum.pdf).

Atlassian carries out annual compliance reviews of its sub-processors, and
where the engagement of a sub-processor requires the cross-border transfer of
personal data, Atlassian conducts Transfer Impact Assessments in accordance
with applicable data protection law for these data transfers. Atlassian
imposes obligations on its sub-processors to implement appropriate technical
and organizational measures ensuring that the sub-processing of personal data
is protected to the standards required by applicable data protection laws.

Further information relating to sub-processor security measures can be found
via the external links below. For each sub-processor below, processing of
personal data will be for the duration of use of the applicable service(s) by
the customer, and for the retention periods as set out in the customer’s
agreement with Atlassian and any product documentation. Please note that if
you use Atlassian data residency, pinned data remains in your specified
location as described on this [page.](https://support.atlassian.com/security-
and-access-policies/docs/understand-data-residency/)
