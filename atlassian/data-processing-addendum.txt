Atlassian Data Processing Addendum
Effective starting: October 7, 2025
This Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) supplements the Atlassian Customer Agreement, or other agreement in place between Customer
and Atlassian covering Customer’s use of Atlassian’s Products and related Support and Advisory Services (the “Agreement”). Unless
otherwise defined in this DPA or in the Agreement, all capitalized terms used in this DPA will have the meanings given to them in Section 9
of this DPA.
1.

Scope and Term.

1.1. Roles of the Parties. For the purposes of the Agreement, the Parties agree that:
(a) Customer is either a Controller of Customer Data, or a Processor of Customer Data acting on another Controller’s behalf (e.g.
Customer’s Affiliate) while passing down relevant processing instructions to Atlassian. Processing details are stated in Schedule 1
(Description of Processing).
(b) Atlassian is a Processor (or respectively, a Sub-processor) of Customer Data. Processing details are stated in Schedule 1 (Description
of Processing).
1.2. Term of the DPA. The term of this DPA coincides with the term of the Agreement and terminates upon expiration or earlier termination
of the Agreement (or, if later, the date on which Atlassian ceases all Processing of Customer Personal Data).
1.3. Order of Precedence. If there is any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence from highest
to lowest will be: (1) the applicable terms stated in Schedule 2 (Region-Specific Terms including any transfer provisions); (2) Schedule 1
(Description of Processing); (3) the main body of this DPA; and (4) the Agreement.
2.

Processing of Personal Data.

2.1. Customer Instructions.
(a) This DPA, the Agreement, applicable Orders and Customer’s use of the Products (including relevant configurations and settings) and
related Support and Advisory Services constitute Customer’s documented instructions regarding Atlassian’s Processing of Customer Data
(“Documented Instructions”).
(b) Atlassian must Process Customer Data solely in accordance with the Documented Instructions, as further stated in Section 6.1 of
Schedule 1 (Description of Processing). Customer:
(i)

must ensure its Documented Instructions comply with Applicable Data Protection Law. Atlassian is not responsible for monitoring
Customer's compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law; and

(ii)

is responsible for determining whether the Products and related Support and Advisory Services are appropriate for the Processing of
Customer Data under Applicable Data Protection Law.

2.2. Confidentiality. Atlassian must treat Customer Personal Data as Customer’s Confidential Information under the Agreement. Atlassian
must ensure personnel authorized to Process Personal Data are bound by written or statutory obligations of confidentiality.
3.

Security.

3.1. Security Measures. Atlassian has implemented and will maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to
protect the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of Customer Data and protect against Security Incidents. Customer is
responsible for configuring the Products and using features and functionalities made available by Atlassian to maintain appropriate security
in light of the nature of Customer Data. Atlassian’s current technical and organizational measures are described here. Customer
acknowledges that the Security Measures are subject to technical progress and development and that Atlassian may update or modify the
Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not materially decrease the overall security of the
Cloud Products during a Subscription Term.
3.2. Security Incidents. Atlassian must notify Customer without undue delay and, where feasible, no later than seventy-two (72) hours
after becoming aware of a Security Incident. Atlassian must make reasonable efforts to identify the cause of the Security Incident, mitigate
the effects and remediate the cause to the extent within Atlassian’s reasonable control. Upon Customer’s request and taking into account
the nature of the Processing and the information available to Atlassian, Atlassian must assist Customer by providing information reasonably
necessary for Customer to meet its Security Incident notification obligations under Applicable Data Protection Law. Atlassian’s notification
of a Security Incident is not an acknowledgment by Atlassian of its fault or liability.
4.

Sub-processing.

4.1. General Authorization. By entering into this DPA, Customer provides general authorization for Atlassian to engage Sub-processors to
Process Customer Personal Data. Atlassian must: (i) enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor imposing data protection terms
that require the Sub-processor to protect Customer Personal Data to the standard required by Applicable Data Protection Law and to the
same standard provided by this DPA; and (ii) remain liable to Customer if such Sub-processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations
with regard to the relevant Processing activities under the Agreement.
4.2. Notice of New Sub-processors. Atlassian maintains an up-to-date list of its Sub-processors here, which contains a mechanism for
Customer to subscribe to notifications of new Sub-processors. Atlassian will provide such notice, to those emails subscribed, at least thirty
(30) days before allowing any new Sub-processor to Process Customer Personal Data (the “Sub-processor Notice Period”).
4.3. Objection to New Sub-processors. Customer may object to Atlassian’s appointment of a new Sub-processor during the Sub-processor
Notice Period. If Customer objects, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the applicable Order for the affected Cloud
Product and related Support and Advisory Services in accordance with Section 12.2 (Termination for Convenience) of the Agreement.

5.

Assistance and Cooperation Obligations.

5.1. Data Subject Rights. Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Atlassian must provide reasonable and timely assistance to
Customer to enable Customer to respond to requests for exercising a data subject’s rights (including rights of access, rectification, erasure,
restriction, objection, and data portability) in respect to Customer Personal Data.
5.2. Cooperation Obligations. Upon Customer’s reasonable request, and taking into account the nature of the Processing, Atlassian will
provide reasonable assistance to Customer in fulfilling Customer’s obligations under Applicable Data Protection Law (including data
protection impact assessments and consultations with regulatory authorities), provided that Customer cannot reasonably fulfill such
obligations independently with help of available Documentation.
5.3. Third Party Requests. Unless prohibited by Law, Atlassian will promptly notify Customer of any valid, enforceable legal process or
governmental request compelling Atlassian to disclose Customer Personal Data. Atlassian will follow its law enforcement guidelines in
responding to such requests. In the event that Atlassian receives an inquiry or a request for information from any other third party (such as
a regulator or data subject) concerning the Processing of Customer Personal Data, Atlassian will redirect such inquiries to Customer, and
will not provide any information unless required to do so under Law.
6.

Deletion and Return of Customer Personal Data.

6.1. During Subscription Term. During the Subscription Term, Customer and its Users may, through the features of the Cloud Products,
access, retrieve or delete Customer Personal Data.
6.2. Post Termination. Following expiration or termination of the Agreement, Atlassian must, in accordance with the Documentation,
delete all Customer Personal Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Atlassian may retain Customer Personal Data (i) as required by Applicable
Data Protection Law or (ii) in accordance with its standard backup or record retention policies, provided that, in either case, Atlassian will
maintain the confidentiality of, and otherwise comply with the applicable provisions of this DPA with respect to, retained Customer Personal
Data and not further Process it except as required by Applicable Data Protection Law.
7.

Audit.

7.1. Audit Reports. Atlassian is regularly audited by independent third-party auditors and/or internal auditors, including as described here.
Upon request, and on the condition that Customer has entered into an applicable non-disclosure agreement with Atlassian, Atlassian will
supply a summary copy of relevant audit report(s) to Customer, so Customer can verify Atlassian’s compliance with the audit standards
against which it has been assessed, and this DPA. If Customer cannot reasonably verify Atlassian’s compliance with the terms of this DPA,
Atlassian will provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all reasonable requests for information made by Customer related to
Atlassian’s Processing of Customer Personal Data, provided that such right may be exercised no more than once every twelve (12) months.
7.2. On-site Audits. Only to the extent Customer cannot reasonably satisfy Atlassian’s compliance with this DPA through the exercise of its
rights under Section 7.1 above, or where required by Applicable Data Protection Law or a regulatory authority, Customer, or its authorized
representatives, may, at Customer’s expense, conduct audits (including inspections) during the term of the Agreement to assess Atlassian’s
compliance with the terms of this DPA. Any audit must (i) be conducted during Atlassian’s regular business hours, with reasonable advance
written notice of at least sixty (60) calendar days (unless Applicable Data Protection Law or a regulatory authority requires a shorter notice
period); (ii) be subject to reasonable confidentiality controls obligating Customer (and its authorized representatives) to keep confidential
any information disclosed that, by its nature, should be confidential; (iii) occur no more than once every twelve (12) months; and (iv) restrict
its findings to only information relevant to Customer.
8. International Provisions. To the extent Atlassian Processes Personal Data protected by Applicable Data Protection Laws in one of the
regions listed in Schedule 2 (Region-Specific Terms), the terms specified for the applicable regions will also apply, including the provisions
relevant for international transfers of Personal Data (directly or via onward transfer).
