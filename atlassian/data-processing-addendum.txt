Atlassian Processing of Personal Data:

2
Atlassian Customer DPA v.07/30/23

(a) When Atlassian processes Customer Personal Data in its capacity as a processor on behalf of the Customer,
Atlassian will (I) comply with Applicable Data Protection Law, and (ii) process the Customer Personal Data as
necessary to perform its obligations under the Agreement, and only in accordance with the documented lawful
instructions of Customer (as set forth in the Agreement, in this DPA, or as directed by the Customer or
Customer’s End Users through the Services), unless required to do so by the applicable Laws to which Atlassian
is subject. In this case Atlassian shall inform the Customer of such legal requirement before processing, unless
relevant Laws prohibit such information on important grounds of public interest. Atlassian will promptly inform
Customer if it becomes aware that Customer's processing instructions infringe Applicable Data Protection Law.
(b) To the extent Customer Personal Data includes personal information protected under the CCPA that Atlassian
processes as a service provider acting on behalf of Customer, Atlassian will process such Customer Personal
Data in accordance with the CCPA, including by complying with applicable sections of the CCPA and providing
the same level of privacy protection as required by CCPA, and in accordance with Customer's written
instructions, as necessary for the limited and specified purposes identified in Exhibit A, Annex 1(b), Part A of
this DPA, the Agreement, and/or any related Order. Atlassian will not:
i.

retain, use, disclose or otherwise process such Customer Personal Data other than for the limited and
specified purposes identified in this DPA, the Agreement, and/or any related Order;

ii.

retain, use, disclose or otherwise process such Customer Personal Data for a commercial purpose other
than for the limited and specified purposes identified in this DPA, the Agreement, and/or any related
Order, or as otherwise permitted under the CCPA;

iii.

"sell" or “share” such Customer Personal Data within the meaning of the CCPA; and

iv.

retain, use, disclose or otherwise process such Customer Personal Data outside the direct business
relationship with Customer and not combine such Customer Personal Data with personal information that
it receives from other sources, except as permitted under the CCPA.

Atlassian must inform Customer if it determines that it can no longer meet its obligations under U.S. Data
Protection Laws within the timeframe specified by such laws, in which case Customer may take reasonable and
appropriate steps to prevent, stop, or remediate any unauthorized processing of such Customer Personal Data.
(c) To the extent Customer discloses or otherwise makes available Deidentified Data to Atlassian or to the extent
Atlassian creates Deidentified Data from Customer Personal Data, in each case in its capacity as a service
provider, Atlassian will:
i.

adopt reasonable measures to prevent such Deidentified Data from being used to infer information about,
or otherwise being linked to, a particular natural person or household;

ii.

publicly commit to maintain and use such Deidentified Data in a deidentified form and to not attempt to
re-identify the Deidentified Data, except that Atlassian may attempt to re-identify such data solely for the
purpose of determining whether its deidentification processes are compliant with the U.S. Data Protection
Law; and

iii.

before sharing Deidentified Data with any other party, including Sub-processors, contractors, or any other
persons (“Recipients”), contractually obligate any such Recipients to comply with all requirements of this
Section 2.5(c) of the DPA (including imposing this requirement on any further Recipients).

(d) Atlassian participates in and certifies compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to
the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (together, the “Data Privacy
Framework”). As required by the Data Privacy Framework, Atlassian will (i) provide at least the same level of
privacy protection as is required by the Data Privacy Framework Principles; (ii) notify Customer if Atlassian
makes a determination it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required
by the Data Privacy Framework Principles, and (iii) upon notice, including under Section 2.5(d)(ii), take
reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate unauthorized processing.
2.6.

Restricted transfers: Parties agree that when the transfer of personal data from Customer (as “data exporter”) to
Atlassian (as “data importer”) is a Restricted Transfer and Applicable Data Protection Law requires that appropriate
safeguards are put in place, the transfer will be subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses, which are deemed
incorporated into and form a part of this DPA, as follows:
(a) In relation to transfers of Customer Personal Data governed by the EU GDPR and processed in accordance with

Contractual Clauses and, accordingly, if and to the extent the Standard Contractual Clauses conflict with any
provision of the Agreement (including this DPA), the Standard Contractual Clauses prevail to the extent of such
conflict.
2.7.

Confidentiality of processing: Atlassian must ensure that any person that it authorizes to process Customer
Personal Data (including Atlassian’s staff, agents and Sub-processors) will be subject to a duty of confidentiality

4
Atlassian Customer DPA v.07/30/23

(whether a contractual duty or a statutory duty), and must not permit any person to process Customer Personal
Data who is not under such a duty of confidentiality.
2.8.

Security: Atlassian and, to the extent required under the Agreement, Customer must implement appropriate
technical and organizational measures in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Law (e.g., Art. 32 GDPR) to
protect Customer Personal Data from Security Incidents and to preserve the security and confidentiality of the
Customer Personal Data. Atlassian’s current technical and organizational measures are described in Exhibit B
(“Security Measures”). Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures are subject to technical progress and
development and that Atlassian may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time, provided that such
updates and modifications do not materially decrease the overall security of the Services.

2.9.

Sub-processing: Customer consents to Atlassian engaging Sub-processors to process Customer Personal Data,
provided that Atlassian maintains an up-to-date list of its sub-processors at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/subprocessors, which contains a mechanism for Customer to subscribe to notifications of new Sub-processors. Atlassian
will: (i) enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor imposing data protection terms that require the
Sub-processor to protect the Customer Personal Data to the standard required by Applicable Data Protection Law
(and in substance, to the same standard provided by this DPA); and (ii) remain liable to Customer if such Subprocessor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations with regard to the relevant processing activities under the
Agreement.

2.10.

Changes to Sub-processors: If Customer subscribes to Sub-processor notifications, Atlassian will provide a notice to
Customer of any new Sub-processors as soon as reasonably practicable, however at least fourteen (14) days’ prior
to allowing such Sub-processor to process Customer Personal Data (the “Notice Period”). Customer may object in
writing to Atlassian’s appointment of a new Sub-processor during the Notice Period, provided that such objection
is based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. In such an event, the parties will discuss such concerns
in good faith with a view to achieving resolution. If the parties are not able to achieve resolution within the Notice
Period, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the applicable Order(s) or parts of the Service
provided by the Sub-processor in question for convenience. If the Customer does not object during the Notice
Period, Atlassian will deem Customer to have authorized the new Sub-processor.

2.11.

Cooperation obligations and data subjects’ rights:
(a) Taking into account the nature of the processing, Atlassian must provide reasonable and timely assistance to
Customer to enable Customer to respond to: (i) any request from a data subject to exercise any of its rights
under Applicable Data Protection Law (including its rights of access, to rectification, to erasure, to restriction,
to objection, and data portability, as applicable); and (ii) any other correspondence, enquiry or complaint
received from a data subject, regulator or other third party, in each case in respect of Customer Personal Data
that Atlassian processes on Customer’s behalf;
(b) In the event that any request, correspondence, enquiry or complaint (referred to under paragraph (a) above) is
made directly to Atlassian, Atlassian acting as a processor will not respond to such communication directly
without Customer’s prior authorization, unless legally required to do so, and instead, after being notified by
Atlassian, Customer may respond. If Atlassian is legally required to respond to such a request, Atlassian will
promptly notify Customer and provide it with a copy of the request unless legally prohibited from doing so; and
(c) To the extent Atlassian is required under Applicable Data Protection Law, Atlassian will provide reasonably
requested information regarding the Services to enable the Customer to carry out data protection impact
assessments or prior consultations with data protection authorities, taking into account the nature of
processing and the information available to Atlassian.

2.12.

Security incidents: Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, Atlassian will notify Customer without undue delay
and provide timely information (taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to
Atlassian) relating to the Security Incident as it becomes known or as is reasonably requested by Customer to allow
Customer to fulfill its data breach reporting obligations under Applicable Data Protection Law. Atlassian will further
take reasonable steps to contain, investigate, and mitigate the effects of the Security Incident. Atlassian’s
notification of or response to a Security Incident in accordance with this Section 2.12 will not be construed as an
acknowledgment by Atlassian of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.

2.13.

Deletion or return of Data: After the end of the provision of Services, Atlassian will delete or return to Customer all
Customer Personal Data (including copies) processed on behalf of the Customer in accordance with the procedures
and retention periods outlined in the DPA, Product-Specific Terms or Trust Center. This requirement does not apply
to the extent Atlassian is required by applicable Laws to retain some or all of the Customer Personal Data which
Customer Personal Data Atlassian will securely isolate and protect from any further processing.

Atlassian Customer DPA v.07/30/23

2.14.

Audit:
(a) Customer acknowledges that Atlassian is regularly audited by independent third-party auditors and/or internal
auditors, including as may be described from time to time at https://www.atlassian.com/trust/compliance.
Upon request, and on the condition that Customer has entered into an applicable non-disclosure agreement
with Atlassian, Atlassian will:
i.

supply (on a confidential basis) a summary copy of relevant audit report(s) (“Report”) to Customer, so
Customer can verify Atlassian’s compliance with the audit standards against which it has been assessed,
and this DPA; and

ii.

provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all reasonable requests for information made by
Customer related to its Processing of Customer Personal Data that are necessary to confirm Atlassian’s
compliance with this DPA, provided that Customer cannot exercise this right more than once per calendar
year.

(b) Only to the extent Customer cannot reasonably satisfy Atlassian’s compliance with this DPA through the
exercise of its rights under Section 2.14(a) above, or where required by Applicable Data Protection Law or a
regulatory authority, Customer, or its authorized representatives, may conduct audits (including inspections)
during the term of the Agreement to assess Atlassian’s compliance with the terms of this DPA. Any audit must
(i) be conducted during Atlassian’s regular business hours, with reasonable advance notice of at least 45
calendar days; (ii) be subject to reasonable confidentiality controls; (iii) occur no more than once annually; (iv)
restrict its findings to only data and information relevant to Customer; and (v) obligate Customer, to the extent
permitted by law or regulation, to keep confidential any information disclosed that, by its nature, should be
confidential.
2.15.

3.

Law enforcement: If a law enforcement agency sends Atlassian a demand for Customer Personal Data (e.g., a
subpoena or court order), Atlassian will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data
directly from Customer. As part of this effort, Atlassian may provide Customer’s contact information to the law
enforcement agency. If compelled to disclose Customer Personal Data to a law enforcement agency, then Atlassian
will give Customer reasonable notice of the demand to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy, to the extent Atlassian is legally permitted to do so.

Relationship with the Agreement
3.1.

The parties agree that this DPA replaces and supersedes any existing DPA the parties may have previously entered
into in connection with the Services.

3.2.

Except for the changes made by this DPA, the Agreement remains unchanged and in full force and effect. The order
of precedence in case of any conflict, exclusively in relation to the processing of personal data under this DPA, will
be, in order of priority:
(a) Standard Contractual Clauses, if applicable;
(b) this DPA;
(c) the Agreement.

3.3.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or this DPA, the liability of each party and each party’s
affiliates under this DPA is subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability set out in the Agreement.

3.4.

Any claims against Atlassian or its affiliates under this DPA can only be brought by the Customer entity that is a
party to the Agreement against the Atlassian entity that is a party to the Agreement. In no event will this DPA or
any party restrict or limit the rights of any data subject or of any competent supervisory authority.

3.5.

This DPA will be governed by and construed in accordance with governing law and jurisdiction provisions in the
Agreement, unless required otherwise by Applicable Data Protection Law.

3.6.

This DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses will terminate simultaneously and automatically upon deletion by
Atlassian of the Customer Personal Data processed on behalf of the Customer, in accordance with Section 2.13 of
this DPA.
